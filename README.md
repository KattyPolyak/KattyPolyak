### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Katty. 
I'm a software engineer specialized in JavaScript with React and Node. I also enjoy the simplicity of Python and learning more about machine learning. 


#### ðŸ”­ Recently I worked on:
- DockerLocal: An Electron GUI Application with a React Frontend that simplifies the process of local integration testing for Dockerized microservice applications. 
- Give'n'Go: A React Native app to connect people who need toiletries/groceries/other goods with those who live nearby and are willing to donate and drop off those goods to them.

#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Python Imageio and NumPy for image manipulation/filtering 
- GDevelop for JavaScript games
- Next.js for SSR and an alternative to Node.js for backend servers
